# Wireshark Network Traffic Analysis

This project focuses on analyzing captured network traffic using **Wireshark** to understand how communication happens at a packet level.

## 🔍 What I analyzed

- **TCP 3-way handshake**
- **DNS queries & responses**
- **ARP broadcast traffic**
- Examples of:
  - Normal packet behaviour
  - Potentially suspicious or unusual packets

## 📂 Files Included

- `analysis-notes.md` – Step-by-step notes of what I observed
- (Optional) `.pcap` files captured from my own safe test environment

## 🛠 Tools Used

- Wireshark
- Basic filters: `tcp`, `dns`, `arp`, `http`, `icmp`

## 🎯 Learning Outcome

- Understanding how packets move inside a network  
- Ability to identify unusual or suspicious packets  
- Improved packet-level visibility useful for **SOC Analyst (L1)** roles
